## Zwift to Tredict

Uploads activities from Zwift to Tredict. It works by making an initial log of activities (and optionally uploading them) before launching Zwift and rechecking activities on exit.

This is early stages but the script does work for [Zwift on Linux](https://github.com/netbrain/zwift). Testing for Windows is to come shortly, followed by a basic user interface, then finally handling of planned training.

This is dependant on an API package I created called [tredictpy](https://github.com/danieldean/tredictpy) which is considered complete at this stage.

Check out [Tredict](https://www.tredict.com/) for a training platform with plenty of toys and customisations.
