## Zwift to Tredict

Uploads activities from Zwift to Tredict. It works by making an initial log of activities (and optionally uploading them) before launching Zwift and rechecking activities on exit.

This is early stages but the notebook does work for [Zwift on Linux](https://github.com/netbrain/zwift).
